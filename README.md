# Brain-Tumor-Detection-and-Medical-Report-Generation-using-Deep-Learning
This project aims to detect and classify brain tumors using deep learning on MRI images, evaluating models like VGG16, ResNet, EfficientNet, and YOLOv5 for accurate diagnosis. Additionally, PDF medical reports are generated using ReportLab to assist in clinical documentation.
